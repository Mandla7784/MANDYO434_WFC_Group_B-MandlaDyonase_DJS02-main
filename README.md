# Whole Number Divider

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Whole Number Divider project! Our aim here is to enhance a web-based application that divides whole numbers. We'll be focusing on improving error handling and meeting specific user stories.

The existing codebase for the Whole Number Divider meets certain user stories but falls short on others. Our task is to modify and extend the code to address all specified user stories, ensuring a robust and user-friendly application.

## Resolved Stories

- **Initial State**: When the page loads, the message "No calculation performed" is displayed, indicating no action has been taken yet.
- **Whole Number Division**: Upon submitting two numbers that divide evenly (e.g., 20 divided by 10), the application correctly displays the whole number result.

### Scenario: Starting program state

- When the button is not pressed yet
- AND the code has just loaded
- THEN "NO calculation performed" should be displayed at the bottom

### Scenario: Dividing numbers result in a whole number

- When the submit button is pressed
- and when the user enters 20 into the first input
- AND 10 is entered into the second input
- the result 2 is displayed in the bottom

## Task Instructions

1. **Review the Starter Code**: Understand the current implementation and its limitations.
2. **Implement User Stories**: Modify the code to fulfill all unresolved user stories. Pay attention to error handling and user input validation.
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure the application handles errors gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user without crashing.
4. **Testing**: Test your application thoroughly with various inputs to ensure it meets all the user stories.
